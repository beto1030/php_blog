Vitae tenetur similique animi earum optio aperiam Libero sapiente possimusThe human eye is a lot like a camera. The camera produces an image by focusing light through a system of lenses to a sharp focus upon the film. In the eye, the retina is like the film of a camera and the cornea and crystalline lens are the lenses which focus the light.</p>
