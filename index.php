            <p>A competent optician requires</p>
            <ul>
                <li>basic understanding of the anatomy of the human eye</li>
                <li>how it works</li>
                <li>what conditions or vision abnormalities might occur</li>

            <p>With this knowledge he may interact more confidently with both patients and the prescribing practitioner as well</p>

            <ul>
                <li>nearsightedness (myopia) - you can see objects clearly, but objects farther away look blurry.</li>
                <li>farsightedness (hyperopia) - objects in the distance look clear, while things close by look blurry.</li>
                <li>astigmatism - a problem with the shape of your cornea (or lens) causes blurry or distorted vision.</li>
                <li>presbyopia - your eyes begin to lose the ability to focus on nearby objects (an age related condition).</li>
